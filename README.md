# Dynamic Links in Flutter

A new Flutter application that implements dynamic links.

## Working

The application gives the user an option to input a text message. This message can be shared via a deep link. The deep Link will either:
 Markup : * Redirect user to play store to install the app
          * Redirect user to application, if installed
And shows the shared message.
